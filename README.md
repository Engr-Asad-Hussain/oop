## Python Object Oriented Programming

This `Python OOP` explains to you the Python object-oriented programming clearly so that you can apply it to develop software more effectively.

By the end of this Python OOP module, you’ll have good knowledge of object-oriented principles. And you’ll know how to use Python syntax to create reliable and robust software applications.

What you’ll learn:
- Create objects in Python by defining classes and methods.
- Extend classes using inheritance.
- SOLID principles in object-oriented programming.
