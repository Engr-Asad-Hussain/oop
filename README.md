## Python Object Oriented Programming

This `Python OOP` explains to you the Python object-oriented programming clearly so that you can apply it to develop software more effectively.

By the end of this Python OOP module, you’ll have good knowledge of object-oriented principles. And you’ll know how to use Python syntax to create reliable and robust software applications.

What you’ll learn:
- Create objects in Python by defining classes and methods.
- Extend classes using inheritance.
- SOLID principles in object-oriented programming.

## Content
- Section 1. Classes and objects
  - [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/oop.py) – introduce to you the important concepts in Python object-oriented programming
  - [Class](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/class.py) – learn how to define a class and create new objects from the class
  - [Class variables](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/class_variables.py) – explain the class variables (or attributes)
  - [Instance methods](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/instance_methods.py) – guide you on instance methods and help you understand the differences between a function and a method.
  - [__init__ method](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/init.py) – show you how to use the __init__ method to initialize object’s attributes.
  - [Instance variables](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/instance_variables.py) – understand the instance variables.
  - [Class methods](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/class_methods.py) - understand the class methods.
  - [Private attributes](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/private_attributes.py) – learn about private attributes and how to use them effectively.
  - [Class attributes](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/class_attributes.py) – understand class attributes and more importantly when you should use class attributes.
  - [Static methods](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/classes_and_objects/static_methods.py) – explain to you static methods and shows you how to use them to group related functions in a class.
- Section 2. Special methods
  - [__str__ method](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/special_methods/str.py) – show you how to use the __str__ dunder method to return the string representation of an object.
  - [__repr__ method](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/special_methods/repr.py) – learn how to use the __repr__ method and the main difference between __str__ and __repr__ methods.
  - [__eq__ method](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/special_methods/eq.py) – learn how to define the equality logic for comparing objects by values.
  - [__bool__ method](https://github.com/Engr-Asad-Hussain/oop/blob/main/special_methods/bool.py) – guide you on how to determine whether a custom object is True or False using the __bool__ method.
- Section 3. Property
  - [Property]() – show you how to use the property class to create a property.
  - [@property decorator]() – learn how to use the @property decorator to create a property.
  - [Read-only property]() – learn how to define read-only properties and use them for computed properties
  - [Delete a property]() – guide you on how to delete a property from an object.
- Section 4. Single inheritance
  - [Inheritance]() – explain to you the inheritance concept and how to define a class that inherits from another class.
  - [Overriding methods]() – show you how overriding methods work.
  - [super]() – learn how to delegate to the methods of the parent class from a method in the child class
  - [__slots__]() – use __slots__ to make the class more memory efficient
  - [Abstract class]() – learn what abstract classes are and how to define abstract classes
  - [Protocol]() - use Python Protocol to define implicit interfaces.
